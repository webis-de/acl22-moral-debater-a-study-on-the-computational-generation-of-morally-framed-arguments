Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: majority, legalization, lgbt and men. \\n\\nRegarding majority.  The majority of Catholics support gay marriage.   In the United States and Spain, it support gay marriage, followed by France at 43% support.   Public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth.   Polls have shown that a majority of the Swiss population supports same-sex marriage, with the most recent one finding 75% support.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about legalization.  Martin O'Malley, the Governor of the US state of Maryland, signs a law legalizing gay marriage in that state.   Keep - legalizing gay marriage in the region has become an important focal point of the same-sex marriage movement.  Singer, whose son Andrew married his husband Corey Morris in a same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2009, has also financially supported the legalization of gay marriage in New York, and Maryland.  In Quinn's 2013 State of the State address, he declared his commitment to the legalization of gay marriage.  \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt.  Spearman, who is lesbian herself, supported gay marriage and abortion.   The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation.   60% of Catholics favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, compared to 55% of Americans as a whole.  \\n\\nThe last issue is men.  A study of the conditions for gay men indicates that gay men in the Danish Defence show strength and are respected.   Gay activist Jonathan Rauch has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.   Gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Hello everybody. The crowd posted 886 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: bans, bestiality, wrongs and proposition 8. \\n\\nRegarding bans.  The 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  In 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.  Hunter opposed same-sex marriage, and proposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  According to a poll, conducted in February 2005 by Research 2000 for the Concord Monitor, 51% of likely voters in the state supported a federal constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. \\n\\nNext, a few words about bestiality.  Gay marriage will lead to legalized bestiality.   It is a threat to all marriage.   Allowing gay marriage would lead to legal bestiality.   Conservatives use the argument that legalizing gay marriage will ultimately lead to legalized bestiality.   Gay behavior should be a criminal offense.  \\n\\nThe next issue is wrongs.  Gay marriage is wrong.   Marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism.   Homosexual marriage is wrong, then that would seem to be pretty strong evidence that it is wrong.   Sex outside of marriage is sinful, and therefore gay sex is sinful.  \\n\\nThe last issue is proposition 8.  Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage within California.   Korean-Americans, due to their Republican and Christian leanings, overwhelmingly supported California's constitutional gay marriage ban, Proposition 8.  In 2008, Blake's President Brian Rule donated $10,000 to support California Proposition 8, which temporarily banned gay marriage in California.  In October 2008, he appeared alongside Rev. Jim Franklin of Cornerstone Church, to oppose gay marriage and support Proposition 8, the California same-sex marriage ban.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 420 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues that will be addressed. The first will explain that Gay marriage doesn't damage children. Then, the topics of lgbt rights, lgbt and bans will be elaborated on. \\n\\nRegarding children.  Adopting same-sex marriage would be likely to improve the well-being of gay and lesbian households and their children.   By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about lgbt rights.  Some representatives in the Diocese of Uruguay have supported gay and lesbian rights.   Lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.  In 2011, Clinton took a similar position on LGBT rights in a speech to the United Nations on International Human Rights Day, declaring \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\". \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, Sweden is one of Europe's most gay-friendly countries, with extensive legislation protecting gay and lesbian rights, including anti-discrimination law and same-sex marriage legislation.  The CCAR supported the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage and opposed governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   It oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  \\n\\nThe last issue is bans.  Bans on gay marriage violate Equal Protection and substantive due process rights.   The court finds the prohibition of gay marriage unconstitutional because it denies dignity and equality of all individuals.  When the Supreme Court took up the issue in 2015, Sanders issued a statement reaffirming his support, saying gay Americans in every state should be allowed to marry: \"Of course all citizens deserve equal rights. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Hello everybody. The crowd posted 420 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: damage, societies, children and gay. \\n\\nRegarding damage.  Plural marriage would inflict terrible damage, that he ran the risk of wrecking his marriage and alienating his followers.   A gay bill because it is damaging to the survival of the country.   Gay marriage was evil.   It is wrong.   Gay marriage and incest are bad for society.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about societies.  Same-sex marriage would harm society or the institution of marriage.   It is a form of \"extreme human rights\" and \"will create social problems.   A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political liberty and foster limited government.   Marriage is the most important social institution in our society.  It is considered the source of inner knowledge of life according to the Ayyavazhi ideas. \\n\\nThe next issue is children.  Gay people are more likely to be abused as children.  In 2005, he resurrected his legislation that would ban gay people from adopting children, claiming that gay people were more prone to violence, alcoholism, and suicide.  The gay parade doesn't have any benefits because it provokes hatred among intolerant people is absurd.   The plaintiffs proved how Berk posted answers to questions about homosexuality that said gay people were \"sick,\" \"disordered,\" and \"broken\" and that gay people were likely to become alcoholics, abuse children, and die of AIDS.  \\n\\nThe last issue is gay.  GLAAD describes the association of homosexuality with pedophilia or child abuse as an attempt to \"insinuate that lesbians and gay men pose a threat to society, to families, and to children in particular.\".   Russia's gay propaganda law encourages homophobia, reinforces prejudice and violates the right to freedom of speech.   Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up.   The United Nations views forced marriage as a form of human rights abuse, since it violates the principle of the freedom and autonomy of individuals.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: vote, unconstitutional, lgbt rights and Barack Obama. \\n\\nRegarding vote.  An August 2012 Public Policy Polling survey found that a plurality of voters in the state supported same-sex marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about unconstitutional.  Bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States.   A federal ban against gay marriage is unconstitutional, as it interferes with a state's right to define marriage.  In 2014, he ruled that Pennsylvania's 1996 ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt rights.  In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that \"Gay rights are human rights\" and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.   In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, he reaffirmed his support of gay rights, including in marriage and military service, humorously stating he would have gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would have provided less competition for women.   Polls show that public belief that AIDS is the nation's \"most urgent health problem\" has declined from 38% to 7% since Sexual Ecology was published, and support for gay rights is at an all time high.  \\n\\nThe last issue is Barack Obama. During an ABC News interview in 2012, Barack Obama expressed his support for gay marriage, becoming the first US President to do so.  Polis has also credited President Obama for openly endorsing gay marriage calling it \"welcome news to American families.\".  In 2012, President Barack Obama voiced support for gay marriage, and in the November elections, three states voted to legalize gay marriage at the ballot box for the first time in history while an attempt to restrict same-sex marriage was rejected. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Hello everybody. The crowd posted 886 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: bans, bestiality, wrongs and proposition 8. \\n\\nRegarding bans.  The 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  In 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.  Hunter opposed same-sex marriage, and proposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  According to a poll, conducted in February 2005 by Research 2000 for the Concord Monitor, 51% of likely voters in the state supported a federal constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. \\n\\nNext, a few words about bestiality.  Gay marriage will lead to legalized bestiality.   It is a threat to all marriage.   Allowing gay marriage would lead to legal bestiality.   Conservatives use the argument that legalizing gay marriage will ultimately lead to legalized bestiality.   Gay behavior should be a criminal offense.  \\n\\nThe next issue is wrongs.  Gay marriage is wrong.   Marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism.   Homosexual marriage is wrong, then that would seem to be pretty strong evidence that it is wrong.   Sex outside of marriage is sinful, and therefore gay sex is sinful.  \\n\\nThe last issue is proposition 8.  Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage within California.   Korean-Americans, due to their Republican and Christian leanings, overwhelmingly supported California's constitutional gay marriage ban, Proposition 8.  In 2008, Blake's President Brian Rule donated $10,000 to support California Proposition 8, which temporarily banned gay marriage in California.  In October 2008, he appeared alongside Rev. Jim Franklin of Cornerstone Church, to oppose gay marriage and support Proposition 8, the California same-sex marriage ban.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "2                                                                 Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 420 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues that will be addressed. The first will explain that Gay marriage doesn't damage children. Then, the topics of lgbt rights, lgbt and bans will be elaborated on. \\n\\nRegarding children.  Adopting same-sex marriage would be likely to improve the well-being of gay and lesbian households and their children.   By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about lgbt rights.  Some representatives in the Diocese of Uruguay have supported gay and lesbian rights.   Lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.  In 2011, Clinton took a similar position on LGBT rights in a speech to the United Nations on International Human Rights Day, declaring \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\". \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, Sweden is one of Europe's most gay-friendly countries, with extensive legislation protecting gay and lesbian rights, including anti-discrimination law and same-sex marriage legislation.  The CCAR supported the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage and opposed governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   It oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  \\n\\nThe last issue is bans.  Bans on gay marriage violate Equal Protection and substantive due process rights.   The court finds the prohibition of gay marriage unconstitutional because it denies dignity and equality of all individuals.  When the Supreme Court took up the issue in 2015, Sanders issued a statement reaffirming his support, saying gay Americans in every state should be allowed to marry: \"Of course all citizens deserve equal rights. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage. Thanks for tuning in.  \n",
       "3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Hello everybody. The crowd posted 420 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: damage, societies, children and gay. \\n\\nRegarding damage.  Plural marriage would inflict terrible damage, that he ran the risk of wrecking his marriage and alienating his followers.   A gay bill because it is damaging to the survival of the country.   Gay marriage was evil.   It is wrong.   Gay marriage and incest are bad for society.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about societies.  Same-sex marriage would harm society or the institution of marriage.   It is a form of \"extreme human rights\" and \"will create social problems.   A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political liberty and foster limited government.   Marriage is the most important social institution in our society.  It is considered the source of inner knowledge of life according to the Ayyavazhi ideas. \\n\\nThe next issue is children.  Gay people are more likely to be abused as children.  In 2005, he resurrected his legislation that would ban gay people from adopting children, claiming that gay people were more prone to violence, alcoholism, and suicide.  The gay parade doesn't have any benefits because it provokes hatred among intolerant people is absurd.   The plaintiffs proved how Berk posted answers to questions about homosexuality that said gay people were \"sick,\" \"disordered,\" and \"broken\" and that gay people were likely to become alcoholics, abuse children, and die of AIDS.  \\n\\nThe last issue is gay.  GLAAD describes the association of homosexuality with pedophilia or child abuse as an attempt to \"insinuate that lesbians and gay men pose a threat to society, to families, and to children in particular.\".   Russia's gay propaganda law encourages homophobia, reinforces prejudice and violates the right to freedom of speech.   Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up.   The United Nations views forced marriage as a form of human rights abuse, since it violates the principle of the freedom and autonomy of individuals.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage. Thanks for tuning in.  \n",
       "4  Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 1355 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: vote, unconstitutional, lgbt rights and Barack Obama. \\n\\nRegarding vote.  An August 2012 Public Policy Polling survey found that a plurality of voters in the state supported same-sex marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about unconstitutional.  Bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States.   A federal ban against gay marriage is unconstitutional, as it interferes with a state's right to define marriage.  In 2014, he ruled that Pennsylvania's 1996 ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt rights.  In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that \"Gay rights are human rights\" and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.   In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, he reaffirmed his support of gay rights, including in marriage and military service, humorously stating he would have gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would have provided less competition for women.   Polls show that public belief that AIDS is the nation's \"most urgent health problem\" has declined from 38% to 7% since Sexual Ecology was published, and support for gay rights is at an all time high.  \\n\\nThe last issue is Barack Obama. During an ABC News interview in 2012, Barack Obama expressed his support for gay marriage, becoming the first US President to do so.  Polis has also credited President Obama for openly endorsing gay marriage calling it \"welcome news to American families.\".  In 2012, President Barack Obama voiced support for gay marriage, and in the November elections, three states voted to legalize gay marriage at the ballot box for the first time in history while an attempt to restrict same-sex marriage was rejected. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

In addition, the slave trade, economy and the working class will be discussed. \\n\\nAbout poverty.  The two leaders described the US-supported Free Trade Area of the Americas as an \"expression of a hunger to dominate the region\" and said that the free trade area will result in increase in poverty and subordination in Latin America.   Nearly two decades of free trade have deepened the poverty and unemployment in Mexico's countryside.   Such trade agreements contributed to poverty within France and encouraged illicit economic activity.  \\n\\nLet's move to the slave trade.  Great Britain prohibited the African slave trade under the Slave Trade Act 1807.   To people of the diaspora the Trans-Atlantic slave trade is seen as barbaric, inhumane and heinous.   British missionaries sought the outright abolition of the slave trade because it would ease their evangelical work and would result in legitimate commerces.   William Wilberforce's Slave Trade Act 1807 abolished the slave trade in the British Empire.  \\n\\nMoving on to economy.  Canadian Tories were also strongly opposed to free trade with the U.S, fearing economic and cultural assimilation.   But contrary to British belief, free trade did not improve the economic situation and increased competition from foreign production eventually devastated Britain's old rural economy.   It also leads to costs associated with workers displaced by import competition and offshore outsourcing.   The statement reflected the Canadian public concern that the free trade agreement would lead to unprecedented American economic and cultural dominance.  \\n\\nThe final point is the working class.

Free trade Wyden supports free trade; while in the House, he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement and has subsequently supported many trade deals in the Senate being one of the very few Democrats to vote in favor of the Central America Free Trade Agreement.  \\n\\nLet's move to policy.  Koch supports policies that promote individual liberty and free market principles, and supports reduced government spending.   Lower business taxes, tax incentives to encourage employers to hire, reduced red tape and government spending, business friendly labour laws and policies facilitating trade help create conducive business climate, thus creating jobs.   In the second half of the 19th century, free trade policies and technological advances such as the telephone and the telegraph, introduced a period of prosperity for the silk trade.  \\n\\nMoving on to economy.  Foreign trade played an important role in the Czechoslovak national economy.   Advances in telecommunications and transportation, the expansion of capitalism and democracy, and free trade agreements have resulted in unprecedented global economic and cultural integration.   Free trade would help America because it would allow the U.S. to boost its exports and grow the economy.   Trade can grow as a result of specialisation, division of labour, and most importantly via comparative advantage.  \\n\\nThe final point is treaties.

Great Britain prohibited the African slave trade under the Slave Trade Act 1807.   To people of the diaspora the Trans-Atlantic slave trade is seen as barbaric, inhumane and heinous.

Free trade will ultimately benefit all of society.   It would lead to a more equitable society, making essential products available to all.  The organization, which was founded in 2011 under the name Association for American Innovation, is purposed to promote \"the benefits of free markets and a free society.\".  A free society is emerging, and a free society is necessary for our own security and peace.   Led by Richard Cobden and John Bright, it won a wide hearing for its argument that free trade would lead to a more equitable society, making essential products available to all.  \\n\\nLet's move to comparative advantage.  Economic theory, under the principle of comparative advantage, shows that the gains from free trade outweigh any losses as free trade creates more jobs than it destroys because it allows countries to specialize in the production of goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage.   Free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of comparative advantage.   In 1817, David Ricardo, James Mill and Robert Torrens showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of comparative advantage.  \\n\\nMoving on to role.  Trade plays an important role in the economic development of the city.   It plays a major role in Serbian economic output.   Since Denmark's entry into the European Economic Community, border trade has played an important role in Flensburg's economic life.   A mutual trade plays an important role in the economy of both countries.  \\n\\nThe final point is regions.

       "53  There are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Free Trade: national security, conviction, globalization and farmers. \\n\\nAbout national security.  \"The international illegal drug trade not only peddles poison into our communities, but is also a significant threat to national security.\" said Knight.   PAFTC believes that the North American Free Trade Agreement-World Trade Organization model of globalization has failed the US and trading partners when since 2000 Pennsylvania has lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs.   Free trade unionism compromised national security was always an unjustified slur against the trade union movement and GCHQ staff in particular.   Paul Krugman, one of America's leading economist acknowledges that free trade is not universally benefit in that there will be some winners and some losers.  \\n\\nLet's move to conviction.  The city voters-especially German Americans-overwhelmingly rejected the free-silver cause out of conviction that it would lead to economic disaster, unemployment, and higher prices.   The myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.   The notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.  \\n\\nMoving on to globalization.  Globalization and free trade does contribute to social problems.   Free trade is bad because it exacerbates labor's inequality of bargaining power against global capital.   It had made it impossible for Britain to feed herself and had destroyed British agriculture.   Domestic monopolies generate inequality and poverty and global trade damages the industrial base and the global environment.   This trade helps to create inequality, as some families acquire more goods than others do.  \\n\\nThe final point is farmers.  In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.   Critics argue that fair trade harms all non-fair trade farmers.   Fair trade doesn't help the poorest growers.

Classical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets.   Koch supports policies that promote individual liberty and free market principles, and supports reduced government spending.  \\n\\nLet's move to vote.  Cleland was strongly pro-free trade, voting to normalize trade relations with Vietnam, to make China's NTR status permanent, and to extend free trade to Andean nations.   Free trade Wyden supports free trade; while in the House, he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement and has subsequently supported many trade deals in the Senate being one of the very few Democrats to vote in favor of the Central America Free Trade Agreement.   Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia.   He was one of the few Congressional Democrats to vote in favor of CAFTA and mostly supported free trade deals.  \\n\\nMoving on to investments.  Finland is highly open to investment and free trade.   The introduction of free zones has played a large role in increasing the amount of investment into Nigeria.   Free trade zones have stimulated investment in garment assembly, light manufacturing, and data entry by foreign firms.  \\n\\nThe final point is nations.  Free trade could help move foreign nations to economic and political reform.   It would help keep prices low and therefore would assist laborers in receiving their \"natural wage.   In many globalization discussions, it is argued that environmental quality can be viewed as a good, therefore increasing free trade and foreign direct investment would lead to a cleaner environment.   Every nation should begin with free trade, stimulating and improving its agriculture by trade with richer and more cultivated nations, importing foreign manufactures and exporting raw products.

Free trade would undermine Canadian sovereignty and lead.   Others were concerned that free trade would have negative effects, fearing capital flight and job insecurity because of international outsourcing, and also that closer economic ties with the Giant to the South might risk an erosion of Canadian sovereignty.   The statement reflected the Canadian public concern that the free trade agreement would lead to unprecedented American economic and cultural dominance.  \\n\\nLet's move to the slave trade.  Great Britain prohibited the African slave trade under the Slave Trade Act 1807.   The slave trade was one of the major causes of the devastating internecine strife in southern.   It is responsible for the current problems plaguing Africa.   British missionaries sought the outright abolition of the slave trade because it would ease their evangelical work and would result in legitimate commerces.   To people of the diaspora the Trans-Atlantic slave trade is seen as barbaric, inhumane and heinous.  \\n\\nMoving on to protectionism. According to PolitiFact, Sanders has \"consistently argued for protectionist trade policies as opposed to free trade.\".  Free trade had ruined the division of employments/diversiity of employments that protectionism gave the country.   Le Pen opposes free trade and autarky, and advocates protectionism as a middle way.   Lincoln, who called himself a \"Henry Clay tariff Whig\", strongly opposed free trade.  \\n\\nThe final point is result.  The two leaders described the US-supported Free Trade Area of the Americas as an \"expression of a hunger to dominate the region\" and said that the free trade area will result in increase in poverty and subordination in Latin America.   Democracy and the free market result in chaos and higher risk for ordinary Afghans while the already-powerful are provided with additional opportunities.     \n",
