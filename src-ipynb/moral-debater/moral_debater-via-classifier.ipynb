       "      <td>Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 886 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: majority, legalization, lgbt and men. \\n\\nRegarding majority.  The majority of Catholics support gay marriage.   In the United States and Spain, it support gay marriage, followed by France at 43% support.   Public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth.   Polls have shown that a majority of the Swiss population supports same-sex marriage, with the most recent one finding 75% support.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about legalization.  Martin O'Malley, the Governor of the US state of Maryland, signs a law legalizing gay marriage in that state.   Keep - legalizing gay marriage in the region has become an important focal point of the same-sex marriage movement.  Singer, whose son Andrew married his husband Corey Morris in a same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2009, has also financially supported the legalization of gay marriage in New York, and Maryland.  In Quinn's 2013 State of the State address, he declared his commitment to the legalization of gay marriage.  \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt.  Spearman, who is lesbian herself, supported gay marriage and abortion.   The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation.   60% of Catholics favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, compared to 55% of Americans as a whole.  \\n\\nThe last issue is men.  A study of the conditions for gay men indicates that gay men in the Danish Defence show strength and are respected.   Gay activist Jonathan Rauch has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.   Gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Hello everybody. The crowd posted 886 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: bans, bestiality, wrongs and proposition 8. \\n\\nRegarding bans.  The 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  In 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.  Hunter opposed same-sex marriage, and proposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  According to a poll, conducted in February 2005 by Research 2000 for the Concord Monitor, 51% of likely voters in the state supported a federal constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. \\n\\nNext, a few words about bestiality.  Gay marriage will lead to legalized bestiality.   It is a threat to all marriage.   Allowing gay marriage would lead to legal bestiality.   Conservatives use the argument that legalizing gay marriage will ultimately lead to legalized bestiality.   Gay behavior should be a criminal offense.  \\n\\nThe next issue is wrongs.  Gay marriage is wrong.   Marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism.   Homosexual marriage is wrong, then that would seem to be pretty strong evidence that it is wrong.   Sex outside of marriage is sinful, and therefore gay sex is sinful.  \\n\\nThe last issue is proposition 8.  Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage within California.   Korean-Americans, due to their Republican and Christian leanings, overwhelmingly supported California's constitutional gay marriage ban, Proposition 8.  In 2008, Blake's President Brian Rule donated $10,000 to support California Proposition 8, which temporarily banned gay marriage in California.  In October 2008, he appeared alongside Rev. Jim Franklin of Cornerstone Church, to oppose gay marriage and support Proposition 8, the California same-sex marriage ban.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 420 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues that will be addressed. The first will explain that Gay marriage doesn't damage children. Then, the topics of lgbt rights, lgbt and bans will be elaborated on. \\n\\nRegarding children.  Adopting same-sex marriage would be likely to improve the well-being of gay and lesbian households and their children.   By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about lgbt rights.  Some representatives in the Diocese of Uruguay have supported gay and lesbian rights.   Lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.  In 2011, Clinton took a similar position on LGBT rights in a speech to the United Nations on International Human Rights Day, declaring \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\". \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, Sweden is one of Europe's most gay-friendly countries, with extensive legislation protecting gay and lesbian rights, including anti-discrimination law and same-sex marriage legislation.  The CCAR supported the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage and opposed governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   It oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  \\n\\nThe last issue is bans.  Bans on gay marriage violate Equal Protection and substantive due process rights.   The court finds the prohibition of gay marriage unconstitutional because it denies dignity and equality of all individuals.  When the Supreme Court took up the issue in 2015, Sanders issued a statement reaffirming his support, saying gay Americans in every state should be allowed to marry: \"Of course all citizens deserve equal rights. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Hello everybody. The crowd posted 420 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: damage, societies, children and gay. \\n\\nRegarding damage.  Plural marriage would inflict terrible damage, that he ran the risk of wrecking his marriage and alienating his followers.   A gay bill because it is damaging to the survival of the country.   Gay marriage was evil.   It is wrong.   Gay marriage and incest are bad for society.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about societies.  Same-sex marriage would harm society or the institution of marriage.   It is a form of \"extreme human rights\" and \"will create social problems.   A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political liberty and foster limited government.   Marriage is the most important social institution in our society.  It is considered the source of inner knowledge of life according to the Ayyavazhi ideas. \\n\\nThe next issue is children.  Gay people are more likely to be abused as children.  In 2005, he resurrected his legislation that would ban gay people from adopting children, claiming that gay people were more prone to violence, alcoholism, and suicide.  The gay parade doesn't have any benefits because it provokes hatred among intolerant people is absurd.   The plaintiffs proved how Berk posted answers to questions about homosexuality that said gay people were \"sick,\" \"disordered,\" and \"broken\" and that gay people were likely to become alcoholics, abuse children, and die of AIDS.  \\n\\nThe last issue is gay.  GLAAD describes the association of homosexuality with pedophilia or child abuse as an attempt to \"insinuate that lesbians and gay men pose a threat to society, to families, and to children in particular.\".   Russia's gay propaganda law encourages homophobia, reinforces prejudice and violates the right to freedom of speech.   Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up.   The United Nations views forced marriage as a form of human rights abuse, since it violates the principle of the freedom and autonomy of individuals.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: vote, unconstitutional, lgbt rights and Barack Obama. \\n\\nRegarding vote.  An August 2012 Public Policy Polling survey found that a plurality of voters in the state supported same-sex marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about unconstitutional.  Bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States.   A federal ban against gay marriage is unconstitutional, as it interferes with a state's right to define marriage.

       "0                                                                                                      Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 886 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: majority, legalization, lgbt and men. \\n\\nRegarding majority.  The majority of Catholics support gay marriage.   In the United States and Spain, it support gay marriage, followed by France at 43% support.   Public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth.   Polls have shown that a majority of the Swiss population supports same-sex marriage, with the most recent one finding 75% support.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about legalization.  Martin O'Malley, the Governor of the US state of Maryland, signs a law legalizing gay marriage in that state.   Keep - legalizing gay marriage in the region has become an important focal point of the same-sex marriage movement.  Singer, whose son Andrew married his husband Corey Morris in a same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2009, has also financially supported the legalization of gay marriage in New York, and Maryland.  In Quinn's 2013 State of the State address, he declared his commitment to the legalization of gay marriage.  \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt.  Spearman, who is lesbian herself, supported gay marriage and abortion.   The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation.   60% of Catholics favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, compared to 55% of Americans as a whole.  \\n\\nThe last issue is men.  A study of the conditions for gay men indicates that gay men in the Danish Defence show strength and are respected.   Gay activist Jonathan Rauch has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.   Gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

The crowd posted 886 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: bans, bestiality, wrongs and proposition 8. \\n\\nRegarding bans.  The 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  In 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.  Hunter opposed same-sex marriage, and proposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  According to a poll, conducted in February 2005 by Research 2000 for the Concord Monitor, 51% of likely voters in the state supported a federal constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. \\n\\nNext, a few words about bestiality.  Gay marriage will lead to legalized bestiality.   It is a threat to all marriage.   Allowing gay marriage would lead to legal bestiality.   Conservatives use the argument that legalizing gay marriage will ultimately lead to legalized bestiality.   Gay behavior should be a criminal offense.  \\n\\nThe next issue is wrongs.  Gay marriage is wrong.   Marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism.   Homosexual marriage is wrong, then that would seem to be pretty strong evidence that it is wrong.   Sex outside of marriage is sinful, and therefore gay sex is sinful.  \\n\\nThe last issue is proposition 8.  Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage within California.   Korean-Americans, due to their Republican and Christian leanings, overwhelmingly supported California's constitutional gay marriage ban, Proposition 8.  In 2008, Blake's President Brian Rule donated $10,000 to support California Proposition 8, which temporarily banned gay marriage in California.  In October 2008, he appeared alongside Rev. Jim Franklin of Cornerstone Church, to oppose gay marriage and support Proposition 8, the California same-sex marriage ban.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues that will be addressed. The first will explain that Gay marriage doesn't damage children. Then, the topics of lgbt rights, lgbt and bans will be elaborated on. \\n\\nRegarding children.  Adopting same-sex marriage would be likely to improve the well-being of gay and lesbian households and their children.   By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about lgbt rights.  Some representatives in the Diocese of Uruguay have supported gay and lesbian rights.   Lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.  In 2011, Clinton took a similar position on LGBT rights in a speech to the United Nations on International Human Rights Day, declaring \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\". \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, Sweden is one of Europe's most gay-friendly countries, with extensive legislation protecting gay and lesbian rights, including anti-discrimination law and same-sex marriage legislation.  The CCAR supported the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage and opposed governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   It oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  \\n\\nThe last issue is bans.  Bans on gay marriage violate Equal Protection and substantive due process rights.   The court finds the prohibition of gay marriage unconstitutional because it denies dignity and equality of all individuals.  When the Supreme Court took up the issue in 2015, Sanders issued a statement reaffirming his support, saying gay Americans in every state should be allowed to marry: \"Of course all citizens deserve equal rights. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage. Thanks for tuning in.  \n",
       "3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Hello everybody. The crowd posted 420 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: damage, societies, children and gay. \\n\\nRegarding damage.  Plural marriage would inflict terrible damage, that he ran the risk of wrecking his marriage and alienating his followers.   A gay bill because it is damaging to the survival of the country.   Gay marriage was evil.   It is wrong.   Gay marriage and incest are bad for society.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about societies.  Same-sex marriage would harm society or the institution of marriage.   It is a form of \"extreme human rights\" and \"will create social problems.   A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political liberty and foster limited government.   Marriage is the most important social institution in our society.  It is considered the source of inner knowledge of life according to the Ayyavazhi ideas. \\n\\nThe next issue is children.  Gay people are more likely to be abused as children.  In 2005, he resurrected his legislation that would ban gay people from adopting children, claiming that gay people were more prone to violence, alcoholism, and suicide.  The gay parade doesn't have any benefits because it provokes hatred among intolerant people is absurd.   The plaintiffs proved how Berk posted answers to questions about homosexuality that said gay people were \"sick,\" \"disordered,\" and \"broken\" and that gay people were likely to become alcoholics, abuse children, and die of AIDS.  \\n\\nThe last issue is gay.  GLAAD describes the association of homosexuality with pedophilia or child abuse as an attempt to \"insinuate that lesbians and gay men pose a threat to society, to families, and to children in particular.\".   Russia's gay propaganda law encourages homophobia, reinforces prejudice and violates the right to freedom of speech.   Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up.   The United Nations views forced marriage as a form of human rights abuse, since it violates the principle of the freedom and autonomy of individuals.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage. Thanks for tuning in.  \n",
       "4  Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 1355 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: vote, unconstitutional, lgbt rights and Barack Obama. \\n\\nRegarding vote.

Bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States.   A federal ban against gay marriage is unconstitutional, as it interferes with a state's right to define marriage.  In 2014, he ruled that Pennsylvania's 1996 ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt rights.  In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that \"Gay rights are human rights\" and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.

Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: majority, legalization, lgbt and men. \\n\\nRegarding majority.  The majority of Catholics support gay marriage.   In the United States and Spain, it support gay marriage, followed by France at 43% support.   Public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth.   Polls have shown that a majority of the Swiss population supports same-sex marriage, with the most recent one finding 75% support.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about legalization.  Martin O'Malley, the Governor of the US state of Maryland, signs a law legalizing gay marriage in that state.   Keep - legalizing gay marriage in the region has become an important focal point of the same-sex marriage movement.  Singer, whose son Andrew married his husband Corey Morris in a same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2009, has also financially supported the legalization of gay marriage in New York, and Maryland.  In Quinn's 2013 State of the State address, he declared his commitment to the legalization of gay marriage.  \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt.  Spearman, who is lesbian herself, supported gay marriage and abortion.   The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation.   60% of Catholics favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, compared to 55% of Americans as a whole.  \\n\\nThe last issue is men.  A study of the conditions for gay men indicates that gay men in the Danish Defence show strength and are respected.   Gay activist Jonathan Rauch has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.   Gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Hello everybody. The crowd posted 886 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: bans, bestiality, wrongs and proposition 8. \\n\\nRegarding bans.  The 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  In 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.  Hunter opposed same-sex marriage, and proposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  According to a poll, conducted in February 2005 by Research 2000 for the Concord Monitor, 51% of likely voters in the state supported a federal constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. \\n\\nNext, a few words about bestiality.  Gay marriage will lead to legalized bestiality.   It is a threat to all marriage.   Allowing gay marriage would lead to legal bestiality.   Conservatives use the argument that legalizing gay marriage will ultimately lead to legalized bestiality.   Gay behavior should be a criminal offense.  \\n\\nThe next issue is wrongs.  Gay marriage is wrong.   Marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism.   Homosexual marriage is wrong, then that would seem to be pretty strong evidence that it is wrong.   Sex outside of marriage is sinful, and therefore gay sex is sinful.  \\n\\nThe last issue is proposition 8.  Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage within California.   Korean-Americans, due to their Republican and Christian leanings, overwhelmingly supported California's constitutional gay marriage ban, Proposition 8.  In 2008, Blake's President Brian Rule donated $10,000 to support California Proposition 8, which temporarily banned gay marriage in California.  In October 2008, he appeared alongside Rev. Jim Franklin of Cornerstone Church, to oppose gay marriage and support Proposition 8, the California same-sex marriage ban.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 420 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues that will be addressed. The first will explain that Gay marriage doesn't damage children. Then, the topics of lgbt rights, lgbt and bans will be elaborated on. \\n\\nRegarding children.  Adopting same-sex marriage would be likely to improve the well-being of gay and lesbian households and their children.   By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about lgbt rights.  Some representatives in the Diocese of Uruguay have supported gay and lesbian rights.   Lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.  In 2011, Clinton took a similar position on LGBT rights in a speech to the United Nations on International Human Rights Day, declaring \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\". \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, Sweden is one of Europe's most gay-friendly countries, with extensive legislation protecting gay and lesbian rights, including anti-discrimination law and same-sex marriage legislation.  The CCAR supported the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage and opposed governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   It oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  \\n\\nThe last issue is bans.  Bans on gay marriage violate Equal Protection and substantive due process rights.   The court finds the prohibition of gay marriage unconstitutional because it denies dignity and equality of all individuals.  When the Supreme Court took up the issue in 2015, Sanders issued a statement reaffirming his support, saying gay Americans in every state should be allowed to marry: \"Of course all citizens deserve equal rights. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

       "      <td>Hello everybody. The crowd posted 420 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: damage, societies, children and gay. \\n\\nRegarding damage.  Plural marriage would inflict terrible damage, that he ran the risk of wrecking his marriage and alienating his followers.   A gay bill because it is damaging to the survival of the country.   Gay marriage was evil.   It is wrong.   Gay marriage and incest are bad for society.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about societies.  Same-sex marriage would harm society or the institution of marriage.   It is a form of \"extreme human rights\" and \"will create social problems.   A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political liberty and foster limited government.   Marriage is the most important social institution in our society.  It is considered the source of inner knowledge of life according to the Ayyavazhi ideas. \\n\\nThe next issue is children.  Gay people are more likely to be abused as children.  In 2005, he resurrected his legislation that would ban gay people from adopting children, claiming that gay people were more prone to violence, alcoholism, and suicide.  The gay parade doesn't have any benefits because it provokes hatred among intolerant people is absurd.   The plaintiffs proved how Berk posted answers to questions about homosexuality that said gay people were \"sick,\" \"disordered,\" and \"broken\" and that gay people were likely to become alcoholics, abuse children, and die of AIDS.  \\n\\nThe last issue is gay.  GLAAD describes the association of homosexuality with pedophilia or child abuse as an attempt to \"insinuate that lesbians and gay men pose a threat to society, to families, and to children in particular.\".   Russia's gay propaganda law encourages homophobia, reinforces prejudice and violates the right to freedom of speech.   Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up.   The United Nations views forced marriage as a form of human rights abuse, since it violates the principle of the freedom and autonomy of individuals.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

An August 2012 Public Policy Polling survey found that a plurality of voters in the state supported same-sex marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about unconstitutional.  Bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States.

       "0                                                                                                      Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 886 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage. Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, supporting the perception that Gay Marriage: majority, legalization, lgbt and men. \\n\\nRegarding majority.  The majority of Catholics support gay marriage.   In the United States and Spain, it support gay marriage, followed by France at 43% support.   Public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth.   Polls have shown that a majority of the Swiss population supports same-sex marriage, with the most recent one finding 75% support.  In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same-sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. \\n\\nNext, a few words about legalization.  Martin O'Malley, the Governor of the US state of Maryland, signs a law legalizing gay marriage in that state.   Keep - legalizing gay marriage in the region has become an important focal point of the same-sex marriage movement.  Singer, whose son Andrew married his husband Corey Morris in a same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2009, has also financially supported the legalization of gay marriage in New York, and Maryland.  In Quinn's 2013 State of the State address, he declared his commitment to the legalization of gay marriage.  \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt.  Spearman, who is lesbian herself, supported gay marriage and abortion.   The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation.   60% of Catholics favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, compared to 55% of Americans as a whole.  \\n\\nThe last issue is men.  A study of the conditions for gay men indicates that gay men in the Danish Defence show strength and are respected.   Gay activist Jonathan Rauch has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.   Gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage.

The crowd posted 886 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: bans, bestiality, wrongs and proposition 8. \\n\\nRegarding bans.  The 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  In 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage.  Hunter opposed same-sex marriage, and proposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  According to a poll, conducted in February 2005 by Research 2000 for the Concord Monitor, 51% of likely voters in the state supported a federal constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. \\n\\nNext, a few words about bestiality.  Gay marriage will lead to legalized bestiality.   It is a threat to all marriage.   Allowing gay marriage would lead to legal bestiality.   Conservatives use the argument that legalizing gay marriage will ultimately lead to legalized bestiality.   Gay behavior should be a criminal offense.  \\n\\nThe next issue is wrongs.  Gay marriage is wrong.   Marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism.   Homosexual marriage is wrong, then that would seem to be pretty strong evidence that it is wrong.   Sex outside of marriage is sinful, and therefore gay sex is sinful.  \\n\\nThe last issue is proposition 8.  Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage within California.   Korean-Americans, due to their Republican and Christian leanings, overwhelmingly supported California's constitutional gay marriage ban, Proposition 8.  In 2008, Blake's President Brian Rule donated $10,000 to support California Proposition 8, which temporarily banned gay marriage in California.  In October 2008, he appeared alongside Rev. Jim Franklin of Cornerstone Church, to oppose gay marriage and support Proposition 8, the California same-sex marriage ban.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage.

Following is a summary of its thoughts. \\n\\nThere are four issues that will be addressed. The first will explain that Gay marriage doesn't damage children. Then, the topics of lgbt rights, lgbt and bans will be elaborated on. \\n\\nRegarding children.  Adopting same-sex marriage would be likely to improve the well-being of gay and lesbian households and their children.   By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about lgbt rights.  Some representatives in the Diocese of Uruguay have supported gay and lesbian rights.   Lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.  In 2011, Clinton took a similar position on LGBT rights in a speech to the United Nations on International Human Rights Day, declaring \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\". \\n\\nThe next issue is lgbt. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, Sweden is one of Europe's most gay-friendly countries, with extensive legislation protecting gay and lesbian rights, including anti-discrimination law and same-sex marriage legislation.  The CCAR supported the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage and opposed governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   It oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.   A October 2012 Washington Post poll found wide support for gay marriage among Florida voters, reflecting the changing attitudes toward LGBT residents of the state.  \\n\\nThe last issue is bans.  Bans on gay marriage violate Equal Protection and substantive due process rights.   The court finds the prohibition of gay marriage unconstitutional because it denies dignity and equality of all individuals.  When the Supreme Court took up the issue in 2015, Sanders issued a statement reaffirming his support, saying gay Americans in every state should be allowed to marry: \"Of course all citizens deserve equal rights. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is supporting the notion that Gay Marriage. Thanks for tuning in.  \n",
       "3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Hello everybody. The crowd posted 420 arguments, opposing the claim that Gay Marriage. Here is a summary. \\n\\nThere are four issues the crowd has raised, opposing the perception that Gay Marriage: damage, societies, children and gay. \\n\\nRegarding damage.  Plural marriage would inflict terrible damage, that he ran the risk of wrecking his marriage and alienating his followers.   A gay bill because it is damaging to the survival of the country.   Gay marriage was evil.   It is wrong.   Gay marriage and incest are bad for society.  \\n\\nNext, a few words about societies.  Same-sex marriage would harm society or the institution of marriage.   It is a form of \"extreme human rights\" and \"will create social problems.   A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political liberty and foster limited government.   Marriage is the most important social institution in our society.  It is considered the source of inner knowledge of life according to the Ayyavazhi ideas. \\n\\nThe next issue is children.  Gay people are more likely to be abused as children.  In 2005, he resurrected his legislation that would ban gay people from adopting children, claiming that gay people were more prone to violence, alcoholism, and suicide.  The gay parade doesn't have any benefits because it provokes hatred among intolerant people is absurd.   The plaintiffs proved how Berk posted answers to questions about homosexuality that said gay people were \"sick,\" \"disordered,\" and \"broken\" and that gay people were likely to become alcoholics, abuse children, and die of AIDS.  \\n\\nThe last issue is gay.  GLAAD describes the association of homosexuality with pedophilia or child abuse as an attempt to \"insinuate that lesbians and gay men pose a threat to society, to families, and to children in particular.\".   Russia's gay propaganda law encourages homophobia, reinforces prejudice and violates the right to freedom of speech.   Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up.   The United Nations views forced marriage as a form of human rights abuse, since it violates the principle of the freedom and autonomy of individuals.  \\n\\nFor all these reasons, the crowd is opposing the notion that Gay Marriage. Thanks for tuning in.  \n",
       "4  Greetings all. The crowd has contributed 1355 arguments in support of the claim that Gay Marriage.
