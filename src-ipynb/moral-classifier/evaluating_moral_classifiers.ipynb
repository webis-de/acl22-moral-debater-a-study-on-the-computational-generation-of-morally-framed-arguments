According to research and consulting done by the Beverage Marketing Corporation, the global bottled water industry has exploded to over $35 billion. Americans alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002. In 2001, for example globally bottled water companies produced over 130,000 million liters of water. This produced roughly 35,000 million dollars in revenue for the world's thousands of bottled water companies in 2001.   \n",

In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur. <br/> (http://www.friendsjournal.org/bottled-water) (http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/bottled/)   \n",

Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.   \n",

Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.   \n",

One reason is to \"reduce bullying\", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.   \n",
