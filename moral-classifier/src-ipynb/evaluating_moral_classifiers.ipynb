According to research and consulting done by the Beverage Marketing Corporation, the global bottled water industry has exploded to over $35 billion. Americans alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002. In 2001, for example globally bottled water companies produced over 130,000 million liters of water. This produced roughly 35,000 million dollars in revenue for the world's thousands of bottled water companies in 2001.   \n",

       "0  Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur. <br/> (http://www.friendsjournal.org/bottled-water) (http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/bottled/)   \n",

Bottled water also only makes less then 1&#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number! <br/> http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know/Video/index.html?@videoList.featured=31101711001   \n",
