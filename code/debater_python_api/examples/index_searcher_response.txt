In his book The 40-knot Sailboat he explains and details a wind-powered sailboat that can achieve remarkable speed by only harnessing the power of the wind.
Not anymore; we passed that point in the early 1990s, with NiMH batteries and now, with cheap wind power and lithium batteries, the're potentially a really huge improvement.
These technologies include high-capacity storage batteries for wind farms, wind turbine technologies with higher efficiency, stability, wider applicability (offshore wind, for example), and smart grid technologies.
In 2000, Wind Clean Corporation, harnessing energy from wind power, was founded [REF].
In case of a network congestion the batteries buffer the energy of the wind farm and feed it back into the grid at a convenient time later.
So, I agree that the best way to power a car by wind energy is to use a windmill to charge batteries for an electric car.
Its products drew upon a combination of solar and wind power, fuel cells, batteries and diesel generators to generate energy.
In other developing countries disposable batteries must compete with cheap wind-up, wind-powered and rechargeable devices that have proliferated [REF].
